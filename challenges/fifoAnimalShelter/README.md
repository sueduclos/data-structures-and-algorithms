# First-in, First-out Animal Shelter

## Challenge

* Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a *first-in, first-out* approach.

* Implement the following methods:

* `enqueue(animal)`: adds `animal` to the shelter. `animal can be either a dog or a cat object.

* `dequeue(pref)`: returns either a dog or a cat. If `pref` is not `dog` or `cat` then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency


## Testing

* Run test files: `fifo-animal-shelter.test.js`
