## Challenge

In this file, your task will be to create two classes, Node and LinkedList. Both should be exported by this file.

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

* `.append(value)` which adds a new node with the given `value` to the end of the list

* `.insertBefore(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given `newValue` immediately before the first `value` node

* `.insertAfter(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first `value` node

## Testing

* Run test: `npm test linked-list.test.js`
